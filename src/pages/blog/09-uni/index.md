- BGSP, the Bigswap Protocol token, is live!

- BGSP contract address: [0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984)

- 50% of the BGSP genesis supply is allocated to Bigswap community members. BGSP is available through four liquidity mining pools: BGSP holders may vote to add more pools after an initial 30-day governance grace period

**Community-led Growth**

Since its inception, the Bigswap Protocol has served as trustless and highly decentralized financial infrastructure.

We have long committed to the ideals of permissionless access, security, and immutability, all indespensable components for a future where anyone in the world can access financial services without fear of discrimination or counterparty risk.

Now rivaling centralized incumbents on daily volume, Bigswap&#39;s success to date — achieved without involvement of the core development team since deployment — indicates that there is considerable demand for permissionless financial services.

Bigswap has always embraced the tenets of **neutrality and trust minimization** : it is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary. With this in mind, the Bigswap governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader Bigswap ecosystem.

In doing so, **BGSP officially enshrines Bigswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities**.

**BGSP Allocation**

1 billion 250 million BGSP have been minted at genesis and will become accessible over the course of 3 years. The initial three year allocation is as follows:

- 50.00% to Bigswap community members `625,000,000 BGSP`

- 25.00% to team members and future employees with 3-year vesting `312,500,000 BGSP`

- 12.50% to investors with 3-year vesting `161,250,000 BGSP`

- 12.50% to Advisors, Marketing, Promotion with 3-year vesting `161,250,000 BGSP`

Ensuring continued participation and contribution to Bigswap at the expense of passive BGSP holders.


**A Retrospective**

Bigswap will owe its success to the thousands of community members that will have joined the journey over the next few years. These early community members will naturally serve as responsible stewards of Bigswap.

**Community Treasury**

The governance treasury will retain 50% [625,000,000 BGSP] of BGSP supply to distribute on an ongoing basis through **contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining**, and other programs.

BGSP will vest to the governance treasury on a continuous basis according to the following schedule. Governance will have access to vested BGSP. 

| **Year** | **Community Treasury** | 
| -------- | ---------------------- | 
| Year 1   | 250,000,000 BGSP       | 
| Year 2   | 200,000,000 BGSP       | 
| Year 3   | 175,000,000 BGSP       | 


Team, investor, and advisor BGSP allocations will have tokens locked up on an identical schedule.

**Liquidity Mining**

Initial liquidity mining program is live. The initial program will-[p';/[kl;lp
 target the following four pools on Bigswap v2:

- ETH/USDT

- ETH/USDC

- ETH/DAI

- ETH/WBTC

5,000,000 BGSP will be allocated per pool to LPs proportional to liquidity, which roughly translates to:

- 83,333 BGSP per pool per day

- 13.5 BGSP per pool per block (14s blocktime)

These BGSP are not subject to vesting or lock up.

After 30 days, governance will reach its vesting cliff and Bigswap governance will control all BGSP vested to the Bigswap treasury. At this point, governance can vote to allocate BGSP towards grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, additional liquidity mining pools, and other programs.

**Governance assets**

A community-managed treasury opens up a world of infinite possibilities. We hope to see a variety of experimentation, including ecosystem grants and public goods funding, both of which can foster additional Bigswap ecosystem growth. Uniswap has set the standard for automated liquidity provision: it is now time to set the benchmark for responsible but radical, long-term aligned on-chain governance systems.

Bigswap governance will be live from day one, although control over the treasury will be delayed until October 17 2020 12:00am UTC. Control over the Bigswap fee switch is subject to a 180 day time lockdelay.

These grace periods provide the Uniswap community enough time to familiarize itself with the governance system, bring in **a diverse and high-quality set of protocol delegates,** and begin discussions and communications around potential governance proposals.

UNI holders are responsible for ensuring that governance decisions are made in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To help facilitate this, the fee switch has been initialized to a contract UNI holders can use to vote on tokens for which they will collect fees. The community is encouraged to consult knowledgeable legal and regulatory professionals before implementing any specific proposal.

The Bigswap team will continue to have no involvement in v2 protocol development, auditing, and other matters. Similarly, team members will not participate directly in governance for the foreseeable future, although they may delegate votes to protocol delegates without seeking to influence their voting decisions.

In the meantime, BGSP holders will have immediate ownership of:

- Bigswap governance

- BGSP community treasury

- The protocol fee switch

- Bigswap Default List (tokens.uniswap.eth)

Initial governance parameters are as follows:

- 1% of UNI total supply (delegated) to submit a governance proposal

- 3% of UNI supply required to vote &#39;yes&#39; to reach quorum

- 7 day voting period

- 2 day timelock delay on execution

**Next steps**

Liquidity providers in the preliminary set of targeted pools can [deposit](https://bigswap.app/#/elt) their liquidity tokens. Mining is open.
